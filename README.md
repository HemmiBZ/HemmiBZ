- 👋 Hi, I’m @HemmiBZ
- 👀 I’m interested in Home Assistant.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Home Assistant and added my first devices. I will use HA in an Expedition Truck.
- 💞️ I’m cannot collaborate for now giving advices, because I have no experience. Hopefully in a few years I will be able to do that! :-)
- 📫 You can reach me over this platform.
